        "   - **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** is a statistical technique used to separate multivariate signals into independent non-Gaussian components.\n",
        "   - In EEG, ICA is widely used to isolate and remove artifacts like:\n",
        "     - **Eye blinks**: Strong, low-frequency signals recorded from frontal electrodes.\n",
        "     - **Muscle movements**: High-frequency noise due to muscle tension or movement.\n",
        "     - **Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals**: Periodic artifacts caused by heartbeats.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps in ICA:**\n",
        "   1. **Decomposition**:\n",
        "      - EEG data X is decomposed into a mixing matrix A and independent source signals S:\n",
        "        \\begin{equation}\n",
        "        X = A \\cdot S\n",
        "        \\end{equation}\n",
        "        where:\n",
        "        - X: Original EEG signal (observed signals),\n",
        "        - A: Mixing matrix (weights),\n",
        "        - S: Independent source signals (latent components).\n",
        "   2. **Identification of Artifacts**:\n",
        "      - Each component in S is inspected (either visually or automatically) for characteristics of artifacts:\n",
        "        - Eye blinks show large peaks in frontal electrodes.\n",
        "        - Muscle movements are high-frequency signals across multiple channels.\n",
        "   3. **Reconstruction of Clean EEG**:\n",
        "      - The artifact components are set to zero, and the clean EEG signal is reconstructed:\n",
        "        \\begin{equation}\n",
        "        X_{clean} = A \\cdot S_{clean}\n",
        "        \\end{equation}\n",
        "        where S_{clean} is the source signal with artifact components removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Use ICA?**\n",
        "   - Artifacts overlap with brain signals in time and frequency domains, making simple filtering ineffective.\n",
        "   - ICA allows selective removal of artifact sources while preserving neural activity.\n",
        "   - This enhances data quality and improves the performance of downstream machine learning models.\n",
